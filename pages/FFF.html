					<p class="content">There are many types and brands of printers, we use a Creality CR6-SE. That means it is a desktop production ready 3D Printer. The extruder moves left and right as well as up and down. The table moves forwards and backwards. Between those three movement directions, all of the necessary motions are able to be performed. The part is formed by extruded softened plastic into beads on the print bed, and slowly building up layer by layer into the final shape.</p>

					<h2 class="filament_title">FILAMENT</h2>
					<p class="content">FFF or FDM 3D printing requires the use of filament. This is plastic or polymers or polymer composites that have been spun orextruded into longs strands or filaments. These come on spools where they are stored or feed into the machine from. We use four (4) different types of filament: PLA, PETG, PLA+CF, and PETG+CF. Check out the following tables to be able to read more about what each filament is good for and offers your parts.</p>

					<h2 class="part_title">FFF PART</h2>
					<p class="content"> Pictured is an example of a functional part printed to be used in our home. 3D Prints can be for functional parts, proof of concept, or just for fun. People make gifts, prototypes, and much more with 3D printed parts. We offer three (3) classes of 3d printed parts: Economy, Standard, and Premium. These prints are priced differntly because of their inteded use cases and time required to print such parts. See bellow to see a table that compares differnt aspects of these three (3) classes.  </p>
