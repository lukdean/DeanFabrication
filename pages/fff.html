				<h2 class="printer_title">3D PRINTER</h2>
				<p class="content">There are many types and brands of printers, we use a Creality CR6-SE. That means it is a desktop production ready 3D Printer. The extruder moves left and right as well as up and down. The table moves forwards and backwards. Between those three movement directions, all of the necessary motions are able to be performed. The part is formed by extruded softened plastic into beads on the print bed, and slowly building up layer by layer into the final shape.</p>

			<div class="filament">
				<img src="../pictures/fff Filament.jpeg" alt="a line of filaments">
				<h2 class="filament_title">FILAMENT</h2>
				<p class="content">FFF or FDM 3D printing requires the use of filament. This is plastic or polymers or polymer composites that have been spun orextruded into longs strands or filaments. These come on spools where they are stored or feed into the machine from. We use four (4) different types of filament: PLA, PETG, PLA+CF, and PETG+CF. Check out the following tables to be able to read more about what each filament is good for and offers your parts.</p>

				<h2 class="part_title">FFF PART</h2>
				<p class="content"> Pictured is an example of a functional part printed to be used in our home. 3D Prints can be for functional parts, proof of concept, or just for fun. People make gifts, prototypes, and much more with 3D printed parts. We offer three (3) classes of 3d printed parts: Economy, Standard, and Premium. These prints are priced differntly because of their inteded use cases and time required to print such parts. See bellow to see a table that compares differnt aspects of these three (3) classes.  </p>

		<div class="process">
			<p>The process for you to get your part or parts printed begins with an email. (see the options table below for what we need from you to get started) Then we work together to make the best decision on the quality and material to use to get your part or parts need. Then I will send you an invoice, we need a signed and intialed invoice to get your part or parts sent to the printer. Then we will let you know when it is done. The part or parts will be sent to you if you paid for that or we will setup a time for you to pick it up from us.</p>

			<h2>NEEDS</h2>
			<p>The things that we need to be able to get you a quote, estimate, or start an invoice. Call/text me at the number bellow or email us the information to get the process started.</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Contact Info</dt>
					<dd>- name, email, phone number, and shipping address</dd>
				<dt>Print files</dt>
					<dd>- we need .stl, .obj, or .3mf files to be able to 3D print. </dd>
					<dd>- if you have access to the original/native file that would be awesome too. (those are typically .sldprt, .prt, .f3d, .stp, .step)</dd>
				<dt>Part purpose</dt>
					<dd>- is this part of an assembly (multiple parts put together) or is it standalone?</dd>
					<dd>- if assembly, how does it interact with the other parts (is it a press fit, slip fit, or etc.)?</dd>
					<dd>- is this meant to show from or function?</dd>
				<dt>Bounding Box Dimensions</dt>
					<dd>- what size box would this fit into? think length, width, and height. this can save you and I a lot of time knowing how big it is supposed to be.</dd>
