					<p class="description">FFF (also called FDM) is a 3D printing style where plastic (in the form of a filament) is extruded or deposited in a small bead layer by layer. The final shape is the colmunations of those layers. Filament available in PLA, PETG, PLA+CF, & PETG+CF. Different colors are available for PLA & PETG. </p>

					<!--<p class="description">SLA or resin 3D printing is done by exposing UV light to an entire layer of photoresin (harded by UV light). This exposure hardens the resin so that the building of next layers can continued. After the building is done the product will still need to be cleaned and cured to finalize material properties.</p> -->

					<!--<p class="description">A CNC router is a Computer Numerically Controlled (cnc) spindle or router that is able to subbtractivly remove material from woods, plastics, and soft metals. This can be used to cut out complex or nearly imposible shapes and controus. This process also allows for both 2D (outlines and flat features) and 3D (think engraving a mountain up and down).</p>-->
